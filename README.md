This is one of my first Python mini-projects, created as part of my learning journey with the ,,100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

It's a simple project, but a great starting point for:
- Practicing user input
- Working with conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Understanding basic math operations in Python
